# TensorFlow
TensorFlow is a machine learning and deep learning library developed by Google, and it went public in 2015. It is currently the most used deep learning library in the market and is very user-friendly. This library is used to develop machine learning models and implement all the important and unachievable fascinating artificial intelligence ideas. This library is completely written in the python programming language, which is why it's very compatible with python. This library is used for learning, research, and large-scale production-level machine learning models. Google has diversified this library, and the company is working extensively on this currently is compatible with c++, JavaScript, and mobile platforms such as swift programming language.

## Components of TensorFlow:

Tensorflow creates a computational graph (data flow graphs) with tensors before computing the result. Tensors are defined as a multidimensional array or list, which are TnesorFlow language's basic data sctructures. Tensors are also the connecting edges in any flow grapth called the Data Flow Graph. These are multi-linear maps which can be anything from vector spaces to real numbers. So a Tensor can be a scalar or vector, or matrix. Tensorflow programs are usually structures into a construction phase that assembes a graph and an execution phase that uses a session to execute. Graphs save computation by only fetching the values we require by running the specific subgraphs, by using distributed computation, dividing the work across multiple devices. 

## Characteristics of TensorFlow:
- With TensorFlow, the visualization of the graph becomes easier as compared to other libraries like Numpy etc.
- TensorFlow is an open-source library that offers flexibility in terms of modularity in operation.
- Easily trainable on CPU as well as GPU for distributed computing.
- TensorFlow provides Parallel Neural Network Training, which makes the models efficient on large-scale systems.
- It has a feature column that helps in bridging input data with the model.
Provides an extensive suite of functions and classes that allow users to define models from scratch.
- With TensorBoard, a different representation of a model can be evaluated, and the changes necessary can be made while debugging it.
- TensorFlow separates the definition of computations from their execution.

## Applications of TensorFlow
- Image/Voice Recognition systems
- Object Detection and Image Classification
- Scemantic Segmentation
- Self Driving cars
- Recommendation systems
- Text Summarization
- Sentiment analysis of the written text
- Speech Recognition systems

## Advantages
- The TensorFlow library comes with a suite of visualization tools – TensorBoard, for better computational graph visualizations.
- Open-source library for complex analysis.
- TensorFlow supports multiple client languages: JavaScript, Python,  C++, Go, Java, and Swift.
- The advantage of seamless performance, quick updates, and frequent new releases with new features.
- Provides a good debugging method as it executes subparts of a graph that facilitates introducing and retrieving discrete data onto an edge.
- Libraries can be deployed on a range of hardware (cellular devices, computers with complex setups)
- Highly parallel neural network which ensembles large distributed systems.
- TensorFlow allows sharing a trained model easily.

## Disadvantages
- TensorFlow does not offer symbolic loops, but there is a workaround using finite unfolding (bucketing).
- Windows users need to install TensorFlow using python package library, pip, as it is more suitable for Linux users.
- Lacks in both speed and usage when compared to its competitors.
- Currently, the only supported GPUs are of NVIDIA.
- The only full language support is of Python, which is a drawback as there is an increase in other languages’ number in deep learning.
- Though TensorFlow is more powerful and better for Deep Learning but is not suitable for simpler tasks.
